Once a month my family and I go to the cinema.
Itâ€™s our tradition and favorite way to watch new movies.
We begin to prepare in advance.
We usually look for what movies are on and then discuss what movie to watch.
My father prefers popular science films and my mother likes musicals.
My sister watches a good love story with pleasure.
And I enjoy detective films.
We all like different genres, but we never argue with each other.
